          <span class="body-text">
            "Build My Life" by Housefires comes out on top: we've sung it 24 times since September 2017!  "Glorious Day" from Passion isn't far behind with 21 plays.  "Spirit Move" by Bethel rounds out the top 3 with 18 plays.
            <br><br>
            "Good Grace" from Hillsong UNITED manages to crack the top ten with 11 plays - an impressive number given that it's the most recent song on this list: it was released in 2019!

          <h3>TOP 10 SONGS BY EVENT</h3>
          <h5>EXP NGHT</h5>
          <span class="body-text">
            Even since EXP NGHT started up in 2018, it's been bringing all the hype with songs like "This is Living", "Wake", and "Real Love" by Hillsong Young & Free.
            <br><br>
            That isn't to say we don't have our quieter and contemplative moments, though!  Songs like "Spirit Move" and "Reckless Love" are also clear favourites.
