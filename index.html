          <h3>TOP 10 SONGS OF ALL TIME</h3>
          <h5>(by number of times sung)</h5>
          <span class="body-text">
            "Build My Life" by Housefires comes out on top: we've sung it 24 times since September 2017!  "Glorious Day" from Passion isn't far behind with 21 plays.  "Spirit Move" by Bethel rounds out the top 3 with 18 plays.
            <br><br>
            "Good Grace" from Hillsong UNITED manages to crack the top ten with 11 plays - an impressive number given that it's the most recent song on this list: it was released in 2019!

          <h3>TOP 10 SONGS BY EVENT</h3>
          <h5>EXP NGHT (2018 - Present)</h5>
          <span class="body-text">
            Ever since EXP NGHT started up in 2018, it's been bringing <em>all the hype</em> with songs like "This is Living", "Wake", and "Real Love" by Hillsong Young & Free.
            <br><br>
            That isn't to say we don't have our quieter and contemplative moments, though!  Songs like "Spirit Move" and "Reckless Love" are also clear favourites.

        <div>
          <h5>YA Worship (2018 - Present)</h5>
          <span class="body-text">
            YA Worship nights tend to be a bit more on the chill side, compared to EXP NGHT.
            <br><br>
            Once again, "Good Grace" has strong representation when it comes to being sung at YA Worship nights with 8 plays in total.  "Build My Life" is a steadfast favourite, coming in with 7 plays, right behind our top song.

          <h3>TOP 5 ARTISTS OF ALL TIME</h3>
          <h5>By total number of plays</h5>
          <span class="body-text">
            We've sung Bethel songs a lot at Creo.  "Spirit Move", "King of My Heart", "No Longer Slaves", and "We Will Not Be Shaken" are popular go-tos for worship sets.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps not surprisingly, we also really like Hillsong, Hillsong, and Hillsong.  We've done a lot of music from three different iterations of the bands, and cover them all pretty equally: we've sung their songs about 50 times each.
            <br><br>
            Rounding out the top five is Housefires: the status of "Build My Life" as Creo's #1 song of all time certainly helps bring that number up!
          </span>

        <div>
          <h5>By number of unique songs sung</h5>
          <span class="body-text">
            This chart shows the number of <em>different</em> songs we've sung by each artist.
            <br><br>
            With their large catalog of familiar worship songs, the three main Hillsong bands (Worship, UNITED, and Young & Free) all manage to crack the top five once again.
            <br><br>
            Bethel's right in the mix with 14 different songs sung, and Elevation rounds out the top five with 10 songs, the same number as Young & Free.
